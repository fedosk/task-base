You can use this repository as a root directory for your microservice/monolith backend repo or as a root for back+front monorepo.
Docker compose contains a configuration to run postgresql in docker container (itâ€™s up to you how to init the db).
Eslint is already configured with airbnb-base (if you'll use monorepo for back+front it's a good idea to move existing config to backend directory).
Feel free to modify/delete/extend anything if needed.
Example-service is an example of how microservice might look like (don't mind it if you'll use monolith architecture).
